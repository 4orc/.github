Lots of tiny repositories. Usually, in each directory there are at least two files (e.g.) `nbc.lua` and `4nbc.lua` where:

- `nbc.lua`  offers a command-line interface and  a test suite;
- `4nbc.lua` holding  all the underlying  code.

One repository [/etc](https://github.com/4orc/etc) is special and contains the support and control code for everything else.
